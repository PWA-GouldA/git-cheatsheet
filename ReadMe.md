This is my git cheat sheet.

## git commands

```bash
git init REPO-NAME
```
- creates a repository called REPO-NAME

```bash
git status
```
- shows the status of the git repository

```bash
git show
```
- shows the commit history and changes

```bash
git add FILENAME ANOTHERFILENAME
```
- adds the files FILENAME and ANOTHERFILENAME to the stash

```bash
git commit -m "MESSAGE"
```
- commits the stashed files to the repo, and adds 
the MESSAGE that describes what was done


## Other Git Things

**.gitignore** is a file that tells git files/folders that are
not to be part of the repository (that is - ignored when 
adding/committing)
